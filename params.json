{"body":"Doug Engelbart's Chorded Keypad - as an iPhone web app.\r\n==============\r\n\r\nA chorded keypad made as a web app available for iOS5 and above.\r\n\r\nOn December 9, 1968, Doug Engelbart gave a presentation at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco. Dubbed the \"mother of all demos\", Engelbart showed, among others, the first computer mouse, video conferencing, teleconferencing, hypertext, word processing, hypermedia, object addressing and dynamic file linking, bootstrapping, and a collaborative real-time editor. I went ahead and decided to implement the chorded keyboard, which he showed in his presentation.
